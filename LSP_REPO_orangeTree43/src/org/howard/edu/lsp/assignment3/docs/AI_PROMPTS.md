Prompt 1:
	Hello ChatGPT, I was given an assignment to transform data in a products.csv list into a transformed_products.csv list, and I successfully completed the assignment, now my professor would like me to make the code that I used more object oriented, could you please brainstorm ways to make it more object oriented. Attached is the code that I created for the assignment. I used a Product class to store and transform the data and an ETLPipeline class to read the original csv, call the transformation of the Product objects, and then extract the data to another csv.
	
Prompt 1 also included my code from project 1.

Response 1:
	Great, thanks for sharing your code! I’ve reviewed your ETLPipeline.java and Product.java. You’ve already done a solid job introducing classes to separate data representation (Product) and processing (ETLPipeline). Since your professor now wants more object-oriented design, here are some ways you could refactor and extend it:
	
Response 1 then went on to detail 8 ways to make the design more object oriented, including "Encapsulation of Responsibility", where it recommended separating ETLPipeline into three classes, and "Product Transformation in Its Own Class", where it recommended creating a ProductTransform class that is used to transform Product objects using the "single responsibility principle".

Prompt 2:
	Do not give me any code samples, only high level written feedback. Reflect on the extent to which my new submitted files include object oriented design when compared to my old submitted files.

Prompt 2 included my implementation of "Encapsulation of Responsibility" and "Product Transformation in Its Own Class

Response 2:
	Thanks for sharing the newer set of files — I can see the evolution of your design compared to your earlier Product.java + ETLPipeline.java submission. Here’s a high-level reflection on the extent to which your new files move further into object-oriented design:
	
Response 2 then went on to detail the improvements that I had made, essentially making the program more modular and separate. Including the fact that I had separated the data and transformation in the Product class, but I could go further by "making a transformation class"

Response 2 end:
	Your newer submission represents a clear step forward in object-oriented design. You’ve gone from a monolithic, somewhat procedural implementation to a design that emphasizes separation of concerns, encapsulation, and abstraction. While there’s still room to deepen OOP principles (introducing interfaces, leveraging polymorphism, and possibly applying patterns like Strategy or Builder), the structure is now much more in line with OOP thinking and would be easier to maintain, extend, and reuse.
	
Prompt 3:
	Could you explain how the ProductTransform class is not a dedicated transformer class for a Product object?
	
Response 3:
	That’s a really good question — and you’re right to point out that your ProductTransform class is intended to serve as the transformation layer. The nuance is in how dedicated and object-oriented the design of that transformer is.
	
Response 3 then went on to describe how I could make the ProductTransform class more object oriented, which I dismissed as overkill for the scope of the current project, because it was talking about having modular transformations, while the project is only asking for 1 transformation currently.

Prompt 4:
	How would you go about giving ProductTransform an interface based contract?
	
Response 4:
	Great question — this gets to the heart of how you can shift ProductTransform from being “a utility that does things” into “a role in a system with an explicit contract.”

Here’s how I would think about it at a design level (no code, just concepts):

Response 4 then went on to detail how I could implement an interface based contract, which I again see as over complicated for a single specific transformation, if I need to implement another transformation, then it will be useful to implement, but in this case the cost outweighs the benefit.
